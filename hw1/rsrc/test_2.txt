K8s is a production-grade open-source container orchestration tool developed by Google to help you manage the containerized/dockerized applications supporting multiple deployment environments like On-premise, cloud, or virtual machines.
k8s automates the deployment of your containerised images and helps the same to scale horizontally to support high level of application availability
Why K8s: What Problem Does K8S Solve?
One of the primary reasons why K8s became so popular is the ever-growing demand for businesses to support their micro service-driven architectural needs.
Microservice architecture helps companies in :
Independently develop and deploy their complex applications by breaking them into small scalable modules
Help them work in multiple small teams supporting individual application modules, to be developed and deployed with the required speed and agility
This desire of the companies to move from legacy monolith to Microservices has led to the creation of large containerized applications. Each container image in itself is a Microservice that needs to be managed and scaled efficiently with less overhead, this demand to handle thousands and thousands of container became a tedious task for the organization. This problem led to the evolution of K8s as one of the popular container orchestration tools.
The organization adopted a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes due to the following key benefits
